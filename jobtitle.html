Job Description :<br> Prescriptive job descriptions may be seen as a hindrance in certain circumstances:[2]

Job descriptions may not be suitable for some senior managers as they should have the freedom to take the initiative and find fruitful new directions;
Job descriptions may be too inflexible in a rapidly changing organization, for instance in an area subject to rapid technological change;
Other changes in job content may lead to the job description being out of date;
The process that an organization uses to create job descriptions may not be optimal.<br>
